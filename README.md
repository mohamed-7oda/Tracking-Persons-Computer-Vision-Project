# Tracking-Persons-Computer-Vision-Project

📌 Project Description
This project applies YOLOv8 for real-time person detection and tracking in video footage. It detects all individuals in a scene, assigns each one a unique ID, and draws bounding boxes to follow their movement across frames. In addition, it visualizes each person’s full walking route using thick colored lines over the video, generating a new annotated output video.

## 🔧 Features:
* Person detection using YOLOv8 Nano
* Unique ID assignment for each person
* Route visualization with color-coded paths
* Output: Video with bounding boxes and tracked routes

📁 Dataset:
A video of multiple people walking across each other in shared paths.

🛠️ Tools:
Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, NumPy, Google Colab
